The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.
Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.

Example 1:
Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

function hammingDistance(x: number, y: number): number {
    const binary = (x ^ y).toString(2).split('');
    return binary.filter(i => i === '1').length;
};
