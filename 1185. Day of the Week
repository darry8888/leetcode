1185. Day of the Week

Given a date, return the corresponding day of the week for that date.
The input is given as three integers representing the day, month and year respectively.
Return the answer as one of the following values {"Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"}.

Example 1:
Input: day = 31, month = 8, year = 2019
Output: "Saturday"

/**
 * @param {number} day
 * @param {number} month
 * @param {number} year
 * @return {string}
 */
var dayOfTheWeek = function(day, month, year) {
    const weekday = ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"];
    return weekday[new Date(year, month-1, day).getDay()];
};

思維 => 透過Date().getDay()取得星期幾，對應至相對的weekday array。
